Admin in English lets you have your administration panel in English, even if the rest of your blog is translated into another language.

== Description ==

Sometimes we want the front end of our blog to be translated for the users, but keep the backend admin panel in English. Admin in English does just that.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Unzip `admin-in-english--x.x.zip`
1. Upload the `admin-in-english` directory (not its contents, the whole directory) to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
