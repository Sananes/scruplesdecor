 * Tweak: The functions that handle ajax requests have been modified to target cart item keys.
 * Tweak: For extension compatibility, cart item update requests that target specific cart keys do not remove + re-add cart items, to avoid deleting sensitive cart item data required by other extensions. Instead, cart item quantities are simply updated as usual.
 * Tweak: Unhook 'WC_Form_Handler::add_to_cart_action' from 'init' in OPC pages, to prevent products from being added to the cart when submitting an order
 * Tweak: More consistent use of 'wcopc_' prefix for actions/filters

 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, display the success or error notice at the top of the page, rather than the top of the checkout form (which may be further down the page)
 * Tweak: If using an add-to-cart link outside the OPC product selection fields, redirect the customer to a URL without the 'add-to-cart=ID' param to avoid adding the product to the cart when refreshing the page
 * Fix: WC 2.2.9 compatibility: add errors/messages after WooCommerce updates checkout, because it now removes all errors/messages when updating checkout
